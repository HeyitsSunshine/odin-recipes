            <h1>Dessert! Plus! Adventure!</h1>

                <p>Close your eye while you visualize my relatively concrete brainstorm: We've (you and I, and everyone else whose come) thoroughly enjoyed our culinary escape and fullfillment of the previous couple of gastronomic recipe expressions, we have yet to be complete in our meal without thinking about (see that? Hilarious, right?): Dessert!</p>

                <P>I've got a plan, no, <strong>An Adventure of a Plan</strong> for this dessert! Follow me for savory sweet completion (of the meal, or course).</p>
