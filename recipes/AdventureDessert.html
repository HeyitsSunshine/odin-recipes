                <p>Close your eyes while you visualize my brainstorm: We've (you and I, and everyone else who came) hopefully enjoyed our temporary "escape" and culinary fullfillment of the previous couple of recipe endeavors, yet we have to be complete in our meal without thinking about dessert!</p>
                <P>I have a plan,<strong>an "Adventure" of a plan</strong> for this dessert! Follow me closely for sweet completion.</p>
        
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Very few ingredients needed!</li>
                    <li>We can say, in terms of "ingredients",per se, paper could technically be our most needed ingredient, yep.</li>
                    <li>Well then, on-to the directions we head!</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Proceed to your most convenient and nearest store of convenience.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Honestly, nearly any store, be it mega-sized, COST-COmpany sized, however, your good ol' corner gas n' go retail location will work just as.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Enter premises, stare intently at the sugary, and, perhaps chocolately merchandise, if that is your fancy!</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Stab your hand as close into the sugar shelf and choose your delicious treasure!</li>
                    <li>step 5: Now, if you haven't yet consummed your treat in its' entirety, make way regardless to the where our beloved front line cashiers await! Formally purchase the treat.</li>
                    <li>STep 6: We did it! That is the last step I am allowed to teach, by law, so you know,run along now.</li>
                </ol>
