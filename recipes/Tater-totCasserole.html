            <h1>Tater tots: Served Casserole-Style</h1>

                <img src="images/tatertotcasserole.jpg" alt="A photo depicting the finished, savory, saliva inducing jumble of deliciousness that is the King of Kings, the one and only tater tot casserole!">
                <p>While not particularly known for it being listed on Michelan starred restaurant menus, it definitely should as you realize with abject pride: For what the tater tot casserole lacks in plating elegance, it is more than accomodating in comfort cuisine.</p>
                <p>A conglomoration of present ingredients, this baked king of dinner dishes will win over even the most stubborn with its award deserving flavor!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package of the best "generally frozen" tater tots</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1:Preheat range/oven to approximately 350 Farenheit (unsure what it'd be in Kelvin)</li>
                    <li>Step 2:Cook thoroughly the hamburger meat (until color and flavor resembles that of the edible variety), toss in cream of mushroom soup, combine delicately, finally spreading that thickness evenly amongst any baking dish you've got lying around.</li>
                    <li>Step 3:Throw them taters on top, pretty-as-you-like, and then we will hurl this pre-casserole into our preheated oven for approximately until-its-finished!</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Profit! (Kidding, obviously enjoy privately within your personal bed-chambers as needed.</li>
                </ol>
