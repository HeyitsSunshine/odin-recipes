            <h1>Homemade Carbonara</h1>
                <img src="images/Carbonara.jpg" alt="A picture of well put together dish of creat Carbonara, fresh noodles, and crispy bacon.">
                <p>A homemade, fantastic and thoughtful dinner crispy bacon, freshly cooked noodles, cracked pepper, and creamy, eggy sauce.</p>
                <p>An italian pasta dish, originating from Rome and endured through Roman times, to emerge with its Parmiagiano, dried cheese, your choice of fettucine or spahghetti, and pancetta or whatever your flavor of cured bacon or preferably guanciale.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>4 ounces bacon (or if we are feeling authentic: guanciale), cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon preferably extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, generally feel more added is more better. (Amount to taste)</li>
                    <li>2 eggs (fresh, organic, cage-free, lol just kidding)</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese (if available)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste </li>
                    <li>6 ounces preferably freshly prepared spaghetti (alternately dry is still just as well)</li>
                    <li>1 cup reserved pasta water</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Cook guanciale with olive oil and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Whisk eggs, 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese, and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
                    <li>Pour reserved pasta water and drained spaghetti into the bacon-pepper mixture; stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour egg mixture into the pasta mixture; cook, stirring constantly until the egg mixture forms a thick sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Stir remaining 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese into the pasta mixture and serve.</li>
                </ol>
